# 💻 CP-Solutions

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of my personal solutions for problems encountered during **Competitive Programming (CP)** contests on various platforms (e.g., IOI, JOI, COCI, etc... ).

## 🚀 Features and Concepts Covered

The solutions address a wide range of crucial topics in competitive programming. Here, you will find implementation examples for concepts such as:

* **Advanced Data Structures**:
    * **Segment Trees** and **Fenwick Trees** (BIT - Binary Indexed Trees).
    * **Union-Find / DSU** (Disjoint Set Union).
    * **Heaps** and **Hash Tables**.
    * **Tries** (Prefix Trees).
* **Graph Algorithms**:
    * Shortest Path Algorithms (**Dijkstra's**, **Floyd-Warshall**).
    * Minimum Spanning Tree (**Kruskal's**, **Prim's**).
    * **Maximum Flow** and **Bipartite Matching**.
    * **DFS** (Depth-First Search) and **BFS** (Breadth-First Search).
* **Tree Decomposition Techniques**:
    * **Centroid Decomposition**.
    * **Heavy-Light Decomposition (HLD)**.
* **Advanced Techniques**:
    * **Dynamic Programming (DP)** in various forms (on trees, profiles, state compression).
    * **Number Theory** (modular arithmetic, prime numbers, combinatorics).
    * **Binary Search** on the answer.
